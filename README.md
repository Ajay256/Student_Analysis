# Student Performance Analysis System

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **Student Performance Analysis System** designed to help educational institutions analyze and visualize student performance.  
It provides **detailed analytics, visualizations, reports, and alerts** for students and faculty. The system is modular, scalable, and professional.

**Key Features:**
- Student-level analysis (marks, weak subjects, performance trends)
- Class-level analysis (average marks, subject-wise stats)
- Semester trend analysis
- Visualizations: bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots
- Report generation (CSV and PDF)
- Alerts for students at risk (low marks or attendance)
- CLI (Command Line Interface) for easy navigation
- Future enhancement: Predictive AI module (for next semester marks)

## **Tech Stack**
- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `mysql-connector-python`  
- Database: MySQL

Ajay, this README is **professional, complete, and interview-ready**. You can even **print or present it** to show your project structure.  

If you want, I can also **create a small “Interview Demo Script”** to **walk through the project in 5–7 minutes** and impress your interviewer.  

Do you want me to do that next?
